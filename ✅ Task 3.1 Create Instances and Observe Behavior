int main() {
    Buffer b1(100);
    Buffer b2 = b1;           
    Buffer b3 = std::move(b1); 

    Buffer b4(50);
    b4 = b2;                  
    b4 = std::move(b2);      
    return 0;
}

**Questions**

* What constructors and assignments are called and when?
 - b1(100), b4(50) are Constructors.
 - b2=b1 , is Copy constructor.
 - b3= std::move(b1), b4= std::move(b2) are Move assignment. 
 - b4=b2 is Copy assignment  

* What happens to the source object after a move? 
The source object remains empty because if its content is transferred.

* What would happen if you didnâ€™t define the move constructor/assignment?
 Perhaps it could create a copy instead of moving and could cause errors if the source cannot be copied safely.
